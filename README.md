## Description

This is my password generator, created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

## Process

I started out by writing the HTML and CSS and getting the application to look like the class-given image. Then I worked on how to copy to clipboard. Next I jumped around the application, but the basic route was to work on the modal, then validating the modal, then to work on randomly generating a password.

The hardest part was probably validating the modal, and then the next hardest part was working on the logic to get all the criteria in.

## Credits

I used www.w3schools.com for help with Math.random(), addEventListener(), and array methods. I also used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Fisher_and_Yates'_original_method for figuring out how to shuffle my array in the final moments of the application.
